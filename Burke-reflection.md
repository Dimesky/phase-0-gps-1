1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

    The main Git concept I was struggling with was the exact work-flow between Git and GitHub, in particular how to generate pull requests and also how to fetch from GitHub.  I was able to do the exercises last week with little problem but the pull request process on GitHub is still not totally clear.  And while I get the fetch command I still need to practice it for it to become second nature as to when to use it.  I also need more practice on collaborating across repositories on GitHub

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

    The pull request and merge process were clarified and will continue to become streamlined as I get more practice.  Also, it was helpful to work with my partner's GitHub account so that I could see how that type of collaboration would work in industry.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

    I asked my guide about cloning a repository into the home directory, and he clarified how it would import the repository into the home directory without causing the home directory to have a git initialized.  I was not aware of that and that streamlines the process.  I asked my pair about the merge conflict at the end, and we were able to work through it, identify the merge conflict, and resolve it.  That is more clear to me now.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

    The most confusing thing about Git for me still is the information flow between it and GitHub.  I'm pretty comfortable working in Git but I still need to learn more about commands such as fetch, and I need to get more acquainted with pushing and pulling from both my GitHub and other users'.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

    My first experience was very beneficial.  I was able to learn a lot both from my guide and my pair, and we were able to work through the releases in a deliberate and thorough way.  We didn't rush but we did it in a reasonable amount of time.  I was able to compound the understanding I already have of Git and GitHub and also got some clarification on things I didn't understand.
