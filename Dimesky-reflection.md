#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

**I was struggling with understanding the workflow with version control in git & github. I had a good idea of the concepts of why you would need to fork or clone a repository, why you might want to create a new branch, how to make good commit messages and create pull requests/merge branches. That being said, I didn't understand how each one of these separate entities fit together.**

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

**I was able to better understand the git/github workflow and how to utilize different terminal commands in order to collaboratively work on and manage a repository. The GPS also helped me to understand the benefit of having local copies of master branches which then can be branched upon to have a safe workspace to experiment and make changes.**

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

**I asked the guide to clarify some of the instructions listed in the GPS, and he also showed us some command line tips. I asked my pair for clarification of some of the GPS instructions when I was driving, and I also asked him a few questions on branching & merging during our task of creating a merge conflict. I also asked him questions regarding the markdown syntax and how to get a png file inserted inline in our markdown text.**

#What still confuses you about Git? 

**I'm still somewhat confused on when to merge branches from a feature branch to a master branch. Is it only with the prompt from a colleague after a pull request? Is it after a whole project is finished? Is each branch merged incrimentally with every feature addition after pull requests are made? Could it be for all of these?**

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? 

**I really enjoyed my first experience of pairing in the GPS 1.1. My pair was very patient and communicative, and the guide was also very helpful, but also allowed us to figure things out on our own terms. It really highlighted the need for empathic skills and really assisted me in furthering my knowlegde that preceeded the pairing session with our git and github project releases. I am excited to continue to utilize these sessions to expand my knowledge through working with my peers.**
